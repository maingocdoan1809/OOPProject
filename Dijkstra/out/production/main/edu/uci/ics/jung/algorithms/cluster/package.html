Mechanisms for identifying clusters in graphs.  Where these clusters define disjoint sets of nodes,
they may be used to define a <code>NodePartition</code> for more convenient manipulation of the node/set
relationships.

Current clustering algorithms include:
<ul>
<li><code>BicomponentClusterer</code>: finds all subsets of nodes for which at least
2 nodes must be removed in order to disconnect the induced subgraphs.
<li><code>EdgeBetweennessClusterer</code>: identifies node clusters by removing the edges of the highest
'betweenness' scores (see the importance/scoring package).
<li><code>VoltageClusterer</code>: Clusters nodes based on their ranks as
calculated by <code>VoltageRanker</code>. 
<li><code>WeakComponentNodeClusterer</code>: Clusters nodes based on their membership in weakly
connected components of a graph.
</ul>
