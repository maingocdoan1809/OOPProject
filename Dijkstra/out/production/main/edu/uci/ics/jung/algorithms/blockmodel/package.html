Support for establishing and maintaining graph element equivalence (such as in blockmodeling).
<P/>
In blockmodeling, groups of nodes are clustered together by similarity
(as if members of a "block" appearing on the diagonal of the graph's adjacency 
matrix).
<p/>
This support currently includes:
<ul>
<li><code>NodePartition</code>: A class that maintains information on a
division of the nodes of a graph into disjoint sets.
<li><code>StructurallyEquivalent</code>: An algorithm that finds sets of nodes that are
structurally equivalent.
</ul>
