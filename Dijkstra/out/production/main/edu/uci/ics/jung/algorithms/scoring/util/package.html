Utility functions for assigning scores to graph elements.  These include:
<ul>
<li><code>EdgeWeight</code>: interface for classes that associate numeric values 
with edges
<li><code>ScoringUtils</code>: methods for calculating transition probabilities
for random-walk-based algorithms.
<li><code>UniformOut</code>: an edge weight function that assigns weights as uniform
transition probabilities to all outgoing edges of a node.
<li><code>UniformIncident</code>: an edge weight function that assigns
weights as uniform transition probabilities to all incident edges of a
node (useful for undirected graphs).
<li><code>VEPair</code>: analogous to <code>Pair</code> but specifically 
containing an associated node and edge.
<li><code>NodeEdgeWeight</code>: a subtype of <code>EdgeWeight</code> that
assigns edge weights with respect to a specified 'source' node.
</ul>
