Mechanisms for assigning values (denoting significance, influence, centrality, etc.)
to graph elements based on topological properties.  These include:

<ul>
<li><code>BarycenterScorer</code>: assigns a score to each node according to
the sum of the distances to all other nodes
<li><code>ClosenessCentrality</code>: assigns a score to each node based on
the mean distance to each other node
<li><code>DegreeScorer</code>: assigns a score to each node based on its degree
<li><code>EigenvectorCentrality</code>: assigns node scores based on
long-term probabilities of random walks passing through the node at time t
<li><code>PageRank</code>: like <code>EigenvectorCentrality</code>, but with 
a constant probability of the
random walk restarting at a uniform-randomly chosen node
<li><code>PageRankWithPriors</code>: like <code>PageRank</code>, but with a 
constant probability of the random
walk restarting at a node drawn from an arbitrary distribution
<li><code>HITS</code>: assigns hubs-and-authorities scores to nodes based on
complementary random walk processes
<li><code>HITSWithPriors</code>: analogous to <code>HITS</code> 
(see <code>PageRankWithPriors</code>)
<li><code>VoltageScorer</code>: assigns scores to nodes based on simulated
current flow along edges
</ul>
