Mechanisms for graph transformation.  These currently include:
<ul>
<li><code>DirectionTransformer</code>: generates graphs where input undirected 
edges have been converted to directed edges, or vice versa
<li><code>FoldingTransformer</code>: transforms k-partite graphs or hypergraphs 
into unipartite graphs
<li><code>NodePartitionCollapser</code>: transforms a graph, given a
partition of its nodes into disjoint sets, into a graph in which each
of these disjoint sets has been 'collapsed' into a single new node.
</ul>
